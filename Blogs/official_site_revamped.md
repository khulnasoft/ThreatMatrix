Thanks to the work put in place by our GSoC contributor [Abheek](https://twitter.com/abheekblahblah) and the help of all the involved mentors (myself :P Daniele and Aditya) we are proud to announce the release of our new official Site with a completely revamped Interface!

That is another giant step forward to increase the visibility of our Open Source Projects and Community.

With this change, we brings to the community the chance to tell their experience and their stories about ThreatMatrix. YES! You can fork the [official site repository](https://github.com/khulnasoft/threatmatrix) and propose a new article for this blog! Don't be shy :P

Any feedback is obviously welcome! Have a good hunting!
