        review: "As a Threat Intel Analyst, I use ThreatMatrix daily to expand the context of various indicators with ease by simply querying one platform instead of multiple. ThreatMatrix has made my workflow faster as I now have more time to concentrate on the analysis rather than collecting the data.",

And command-line client is no smaller than that. I do think you'll be amazed by the look and feel of pythreatmatrix. Give both a try!",

And it is useful since many robust analyzers are integrated into this solution. As a threat researcher and an open source lover, I highly recommend ThreatMatrix!",
