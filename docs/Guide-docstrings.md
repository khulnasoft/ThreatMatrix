## Implementing Docstrings in Python Code

When you write or modify Python code in the codebase, it's important to add or update the docstrings accordingly. If you wish to display these docstrings in the documentation, follow these steps.

Suppose the docstrings are located in the following path: `docs/Submodules/ThreatMatrix/api_app/analyzers_manager/classes`, and you want to show the description of a class, such as BaseAnalyzerMixin.

To include this in the documentation, use the following command:

```
:::docs.Submodules.ThreatMatrix.api_app.analyzers_manager.classes.BaseAnalyzerMixin
```

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
Make sure your path is correct and syntax is correct.
If you face any issues even path is correct then read the Submodules Guide. 
</div>

#### This is how it would look in documentation:

:::docs.Submodules.ThreatMatrix.api_app.analyzers_manager.classes.BaseAnalyzerMixin
